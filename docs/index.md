title: Welcome to AgentEnvolver!
<!-- summary: Metadata configuration # subtitle -->

**AgentEvolver** is an end-to-end, self-evolving training framework that transforms the critical
stages of agent training—task generation, trajectory exploration, and policy optimization—into an
automated, closed-loop system driven by the LLM itself. By empowering agents to autonomously
improve their capabilities, the framework aims for efficient, cost-effective, and continuous
capability evolution.

### ✨ Key Features

- **Self-Evolving Mechanisms**  
  ① **Automatic Task Generation** – Curiosity-driven *self-questioning* to probe the environment and autonomously create diverse tasks, eliminating costly manual dataset construction.  
  ② **Efficient Exploration** – *Self-navigating* strategies that reuse and generalize past trajectories, enabling more targeted rollouts and dramatically improving sample efficiency.  
  ③ **Fine-Grained Credit Assignment** – *Self-attributing* rewards that infer the causal impact of intermediate actions, providing precise feedback for long-horizon policy optimization.

- **Developer-Oriented Design**  
  ① **Environment Compatibility** – Standardized interfaces for seamless integration with a wide range of external environments and tool APIs.  
  ② **Modular & Extensible Architecture** – Decoupled components allow easy customization, secondary development, and future algorithm upgrades.  
  ③ **Flexible Context Manager** – Built-in utilities for managing multi-agent contexts and complex interaction logic, supporting diverse deployment scenarios.
